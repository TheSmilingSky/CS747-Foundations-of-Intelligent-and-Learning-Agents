In order to run the code and generate the plots, it is sufficient to run the "run.sh" script places in the "codes" folder. Assuming the current working directory is the submission folder, one needs to go to the codes folder and execute the "run.sh" file which generates and saves all the plots to the "plots" folder. In order to this, follow these steps - 

$ cd codes
$ chmod +x run.sh
$ ./run.sh

In order to generate more plots for various other settings (not asked to do in this assignment), detailed instructions about the parameter use have been given at the end of the report.
